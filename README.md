Designed and built a unique web platform that brings together various orphanage homes onto one user-friendly hub. Developed the platform's frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for an easy-to-navigate interface. Strengthened the backend with Spring Boot and Spring Security, ensuring secure data management and smooth user logins. Teamed up to seamlessly connect the frontend and backend through RESTful APIs. Showcased adeptness in ensuring data reliability by conducting API tests in Postman. This project highlights my teamwork, creative problem-solving, and dedication to leveraging technology for meaningful social change.
